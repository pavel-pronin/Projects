# Projects

Repository contains some of the projects I was working on and some of the Homework solutions.

**Machine Learning**

Text:
- Text_TFIDF_word2vec_fasttext.ipynb
  - predicting numeric data from text
  - Text preprocessing (POS Tagging, singularization, lemmatization, spell-checking, subsampling)
  - Simple Text Models: TF-IDF, word2vec w/ and w/o IDF weights, fasttext embeddings
- Text_RNN.ipynb
  - predicting numeric data from text
  - Implementing CNN + BiLSTM + Dense layer with PyTorch
- textpretrained.ipynb
  - finding similar sentences
  - using and comparing pretrained models, fine-tuned BERT, Ernie, DeBERTa 

**Numeric Data**
- Trees.ipynb
